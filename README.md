# ðŸ“– Project Overview
Easily log in using the League Client Update API. No more having to type your username and password. Just add your account, double click it and it will do the rest for you. This software will store your credentials locally in a Json file. It makes no attempt to send data anywhere other than the official endpoint provided by Riot Games. It makes a very small attempt to encrypt the password with a key generated on first startup.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
